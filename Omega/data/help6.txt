BUGS AND FEATURES
=================
"It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature." 

Omega is not just a large program, it is a large, complicated, and not
particularly well written program. There are so many features that not
all can be well tested, particularly in combination with one another.
Therefore, it is likely that your version, whatever it is, has some
bugs.

The official source code repository for this version of Omega is
located at <http://github.com/cwc/OmegaRPG>. You may report any bugs
encountered by creating an issue via the Issues tab, but please: use
the search feature first. The problem you're having may have already
been reported.
